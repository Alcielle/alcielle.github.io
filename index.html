          <p class="biography">
            My name is Abhishek Das. I am about to receive a MS in computer
            science on an AI track with expertise in the field of Artificial
            Intelligence and Machine Learning with a Computer Security base of
            knowledge as well. My interests in the field include developing
            algorithms for as well as generating actual code bases that
            represent neural networks that apply towards reinforcement learning
            tasks with a particular interest in solving game theory problems as
            well as being able to apply the ability of neural networks towards
            tasks that involve parsing tangible and relevant data out of
            distributions. However, I am also capable with and interested in
            general neural network architectures and applying them towards a
            broader task base.

          <p class="prparas">
            I have attempted to use python Q learning libraries to teach a
            custom weighted neural network with adjustable weights, how to play
            poker against competent human adversaries. This project utilizes
            Google Colab to facilitate the necessary GPU speeds needed to train
            the network and have it learn to avoid malicious user poker patterns
            (such as folding repeatedly).

          <p class="prparas">
            Python, nodeJS, Google Cloud backend, and RestAPI retrieval were
            used to produce this simple application that can retrieve recipes
            based on text entries into a given HTML field. Viewing access to
            test and deploy this app can be requested via email as seen in the
            Contact Me section.

          <p class="prparas">
            An Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was implemented using python with basic
            functionality, direct messaging and broadcast capability, as well as
            connection and user error handling built in. Simple functionality
            but an efficient deployment. This project demonstrates the ability
            to leverage python to accomplish and show logical code organization
            and flow.
